# Reverse an Array

## Challenge
Write a function that reverses an array so that the initial values are in reverse order (without using built-in array methods).

## Approach & Efficiency
We wrote a 'for' loop that works it's way from the outside of the array in, switches the values, and adds it to a new array. It is fairly efficient and loops through as mamy times as half the length of the array.

## Solution
